# 🎲 Dicee Game

A fun and interactive Dicee game built using **HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript**.\
Each time the page is refreshed, two dice are rolled randomly and the
winner is displayed based on the higher dice value.

## 🚀 Features

-   Random dice roll on every refresh\
-   Displays winner or draw result instantly\

-   Beginner-friendly JavaScript logic

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **HTML** -- Structure of the web page\
-   **CSS** -- Styling and layout\
-   **JavaScript** -- Game logic and random number generation

## 🎮 How the Game Works

1.  When the page loads, two random numbers between 1 and 6 are
    generated.\
2.  Dice images change according to the random numbers.\

    -   Displays a draw if both values are equal
